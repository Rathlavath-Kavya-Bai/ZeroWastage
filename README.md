ZeroWaste: Smart Food Redistribution System

âœ… Problem Statement / Use Case
Tons of edible food go to waste daily in restaurants, homes, events, and supermarkets, while millions of people go hungry. There is a need for a system that connects food donors (like hotels, households, and grocery stores) with NGOs and food banks to redistribute surplus food efficiently and safely.

âœ… Abstract / Problem Description (Max 300 words)
Food waste is a global issue that not only leads to resource loss but also contributes to climate change. At the same time, hunger remains a major problem in many parts of the world. The ZeroWaste project addresses both issues by creating a smart platform that enables real-time food donation and redistribution.

The platform connects food donors such as restaurants, households, supermarkets, and event organizers with NGOs, food banks, and volunteers who can collect and redistribute the surplus. It features a web and mobile interface where donors can quickly post available food items with details like quantity, expiry, and location.

NGOs and collection agents are notified instantly of available donations nearby and can claim pickups. A smart scheduling system ensures optimized pickup routes using location data and time constraints to prevent food spoilage.

Additionally, the system features a dashboard for impact trackingâ€”like how much food has been saved, how many people have been fed, and COâ‚‚ emissions prevented.

The end goal is to create a sustainable food ecosystem that reduces waste, feeds the hungry, and promotes responsible consumption.
